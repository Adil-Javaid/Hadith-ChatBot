He (the Prophet, sal Allaahu alayhi wa sallam) also commanded the Muslims to use three stones and forbade them to use dung or decayed bone.","The hadith narrated by Abu Hurairah reinforces the Prophet Muhammad's (peace be upon him) guidance on proper toilet etiquette. It emphasizes the importance of avoiding facing or turning away from the Qiblah during urination or defecation, using the left hand for cleansing, and using a minimum of three stones for cleansing while avoiding the use of dung or decayed bone. These guidelines reflect the Prophet's concern for cleanliness, modesty, and respect for religious practices."

(Abu Ayyub said): When we came to Syria, we found that the toilets already built there were facing the qiblah, We turned our faces away from them and begged pardon of Allaah.","The hadith narrated by Abu Ayyub further reinforces the Prophet Muhammad's (peace be upon him) guidance on toilet etiquette. It specifically instructs Muslims to avoid facing or turning away from the Qiblah during urination or defecation, instead turning towards the east or west. Abu Ayyub's experience in Syria highlights the importance of adhering to this guidance even in unfamiliar environments, as he and his companions adjusted their toilet practices to avoid facing the Qiblah. This demonstrates their commitment to following the Prophet's teachings and their understanding of the significance of respecting the Qiblah."
1.0,4.0,10.0,Narrated Ma'qil ibn AbuMa'qil al-Asadi: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) has forbidden us to face the two qiblahs at the time of urination or excretion.,The hadith narrated by Ma'qil ibn AbuMa'qil al-Asadi reinforces the Prophet Muhammad's (peace be upon him) guidance on toilet etiquette.

This instruction demonstrates the Prophet's emphasis on respecting the sanctity of the Qiblah and maintaining a sense of reverence even in personal matters.
1.0,4.0,11.0,"Marwan al-Asfar said: I saw Ibn Umar make his camel kneel down facing the qiblah, then he sat down urinating in its direction. So I said: AbuAbdurRahman, has this not been forbidden? He replied: Why not, that was forbidden only in open country; but when there is something between you and the qiblah that conceals you , then there is no harm.","The hadith narrated by Marwan al-Asfar highlights a specific circumstance regarding toilet etiquette. It describes Ibn Umar's practice of urinating while facing the Qiblah, which was generally forbidden. However, Ibn Umar justified his action by explaining that the prohibition applies only in open areas where there is no physical barrier between the person and the Qiblah. In situations where there is something that conceals the person from the Qiblah, such as a camel, the prohibition does not apply. This clarifies a potential exception to the general rule of avoiding facing the Qiblah during urination or defecation, demonstrating the importance of understanding the nuances of Islamic teachings and their application in different contexts."
1.0,5.0,12.0,Narrated 'Abd Allaah b. 'Umar : I ascended the roof of the house and saw the Apostle of Allaah ( sal Allaahu alayhi wa sallam) sitting on two bricks facing Jerusalem (Bait al-Maqdis) for relieving himself.,"The hadith narrated by 'Abd Allaah b. 'Umar describes a specific instance where the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) relieved himself while facing Jerusalem, which was the original Qiblah before the direction was changed to Mecca. This suggests that the prohibition against facing the Qiblah during urination or defecation was not strictly enforced in all circumstances, particularly in private settings. However, it's important to note that this specific instance does not contradict the general guidance provided in other hadiths regarding avoiding the Qiblah during these activities."
1.0,5.0,13.0,Narrated Jabir ibn Abdullah: The Prophet of Allah (ﷺ) forbade us to face the qiblah at the time of making water.Then I saw him facing it (qiblah) urinating or easing himself one year before his death.,"The hadith narrated by Jabir ibn Abdullah initially states that the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) forbade Muslims from facing the Qiblah during urination or defecation. However, it later mentions a specific instance where the Prophet himself was observed facing the Qiblah while relieving himself. This suggests that the prohibition might not have been strictly enforced in all circumstances, possibly due to specific situations or personal preferences. The overall guidance remains consistent, emphasizing the importance of respecting the Qiblah and maintaining a sense of reverence even in personal matters."
1.0,6.0,14.0,"Narrated Abdullah ibn Umar: When the Prophet (ﷺ) wanted to relieve himself, he would not raise his garment, until he lowered himself near the ground.Abu DAwud said: This tradition has been transmitted by 'Abd al-Salam b. Harb on the authority of al-A'mash from Anas b. Malik. This chain of narrators is weak (because A'mash's hearing tradition from Anas b. Malik is not established).","The hadith narrated by Abdullah ibn Umar describes the Prophet Muhammad's (peace be upon him) practice of not raising his garment until he was close to the ground when relieving himself. However, the chain of narrators for this tradition is considered weak, as there is uncertainty about the reliability of al-A'mash's transmission from Anas ibn Malik.

'Ammar.","The hadith narrated by Abu Sa'id al-Khudri emphasizes the importance of modesty and respect for personal privacy, particularly when relieving oneself. It warns that Allah (SWT) becomes displeased when two people uncover their private parts and engage in conversation while doing so. The tradition also highlights the potential negative consequences of disregarding these principles. While the chain of narrators for this hadith is relatively short, it provides valuable guidance on proper behavior and conduct."

It describes an instance where a man greeted the Prophet (peace be upon him) while he was urinating, and the Prophet did not respond to the salutation. However, the Prophet later performed tayammum (dry ablution) and then returned the salutation, suggesting that the initial omission was due to the sensitivity of the situation and the Prophet's desire to maintain modesty.

On the authority of Anas the well-known version says: The Prophet (ﷺ) had a silver ring made for him. Then he cast it off. The misunderstanding is on the part of Hammam (who is the narrator of the previous tradition mentioned in the text). This is transmitted only by Hammam.","While this hadith is considered weak, it may suggest that the Prophet (PBUH) believed in avoiding unnecessary adornments during personal activities. This could be interpreted as a form of modesty or a desire to focus on the spiritual aspects of life."

One did not safeguard himself from urine. The other carried tales. He then called for a fresh twig and split it into two partsand planted one part on each grave and said: Perhaps their punishment may be mitigated as long as the twigs remain fresh.Another version of Hannad has: ""One of them did not cover himself while urinating."" This version does not have the words: ""He did not safeguard himself from urine.""","The Prophet (PBUH) warned against the severe consequences of neglecting modesty and proper behavior, even in personal matters.
